# Platform Game: Impact Force

## This repository contains the source code for a 3D platform game developed with Unity 3D. The goal of the game is to control a ball and knock down enemy balls that fall from the platform, rather than being knocked down themselves. The game includes a power-up that increases the player's impact force on the enemy balls.
